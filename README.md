# RTI
# Abstract
The rubber tail illusion (RTI) is an experimental paradigm that investigates body boundary perception of a fake rubber tail in rats by manipulating multisensory integration of visual, somatosensory, and proprioceptive stimuli. In the illusion, rodents perceive a fake rubber tail as part of their body boundary perception through synchronous stroking of their real tail which is hidden and a fake rubber tail which is seen. To date, RTI has only been demonstrated in mice and the existence of body boundary perception in rats remains largely unexplored. It is hypothesized that body elongation can serve as a behavioral indicator of body boundary perception and more elongation follows synchronous stroking compared to asynchronous stroking and fake tail grasping. The following experiment explored body boundary perception in 24 Sprague Dawley rats by using RTI and measuring body elongation two seconds following tail grasping using EthoVisionÂ® XT. Experiment 1 served as a control for reactivity to real or rubber tail grasping without any stroking. Experiment 2 investigated the robustness of RTI by grasping the fake rubber tail following manual administration of synchronous or asynchronous stroking of both tails. In Experiment 1, there was no difference in body elongation percentage between real or fake tail grasping. In Experiment 2, synchronous stroking exhibited a higher body elongation percentage compared to asynchronous stroking. The results of the study provide supporting evidence for the efficacy of the RTI paradigm in rats and further study of RTI can inform our understanding of multisensory processes on body boundary perception manipulations.
